# vue-todo-app

This project is one of the working examples from the book [Beginning Vue 3 Development](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Vue-Development-Vue-js-development/dp/B0BM3PQD36) by Greg Lim.

This app has a dependency of an external API to manage the dataset. Currently, the app connects to a `json-server` api (at localhost:4000). To install and setup json server, run:

```
> npm install -g json-server
> json-server -p 4000 backendapp/todos.json

  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading backendapp/todos.json
  Done

  Resources
